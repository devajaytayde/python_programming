#Default file folder is the one where python.exe  is stored
#For ex. C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313

#Read file
f = open('NEWS.txt','r')
for i in range(1,10):
  l = f.readline()
  print(l[:-1])

#Read file in one go
fo = open('NEWS.txt','r')
lst = fo.readline() #run only once

or

lst = fo.read()

or going into sub-folder for ex. 'demo' and open inner file

fl = open('demo/temp1.txt','r')

#Write file
