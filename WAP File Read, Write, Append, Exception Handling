#Default file folder is the one where python.exe  is stored
#For ex. C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313

#Read file

#Read file in one go

or

or going into sub-folder for ex. 'demo' and open inner file

#Write file - writeline is a function name which can be anything

with open("text5.txt","a") as writeline:

#Expection Handling
#1. When file creation time, file already exists



#2. When file reading time, file not exists
try:
  f = open("text6.txt","r")
except FileNotFoundError:
  print("No such file exists")
